        "Wheat, a staple crop, undergoes a fascinating journey from field to table. Farmers begin by planting wheat seeds in prepared soil, using drills pulled by tractors. As the wheat grows, they monitor its health and address any issues. When its time for harvest, mechanical combine harvesters come into play. These efficient machines cut the wheat stalks, separate the grain from the straw, and collect the kernelsâ€”all in one operation. The harvested grain is then transported to grain elevators, cleaned, and stored. Ultimately, its processed into flour and other wheat-based products that reach our tables",

Next, threshing separates the grains from the chaff. The cleaned grains are then processed to remove bran and germ, resulting in granular pieces used for making flour. Finally, the valuable wheat grains are ready for storage or further use",
